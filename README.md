# Tailwind CSS Flexbox Unexpected Behavior
This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior when using Tailwind CSS classes with flexbox. The divs do not render side-by-side as expected.

## Bug Description
When using the `flex` class on a parent element, and then applying background colors and padding to its child elements, the child elements do not display side-by-side. Instead, they stack vertically.
